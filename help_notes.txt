Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
And fatal to the sense those murd'rous eyes,
Life and food to me, being more pure than I,
The varying passions of the heart could hold:
Renew the Arts on Britain's shore,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell,
Co-heir t' his glory, and Sabbath' endless rest.
Love led them on; and Faith, who knew them best
But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
It pleaseth me, if I my woes rehearse,
And set my breast, his lodging, on a fire.
All is, if I have grace to use it so,
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed.

Music and silver chimes and sunlit air,
Drown'd in the tears extorted by my lines,
Breathes once and, quench√®d faster than it came,
The young leaves scarcely trembling; the blue-grey
So, in the like name of that love of ours,
Blue curtains, scatter thy silver dew
Of melancholy, tenderer in its moods
In lifting upward, as in crushing low!
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
And wash the dusk with silver. Soon, full, soon,
Some merry jest, or tale of murder dire,
And in my lines if she my love may see.
But what, without the social thought of thee,
As with your shadow I with these did play.


`Now Art has lost its mental charms
France shall subdue the world in arms.'
While the thin vapours break along the sand,
Adventurous knights take up their dinted shields;
And this we know: Death is not Life, effete,
For skies Italian, and an inward groan
Go, cull the dew-drops from each potent flow'r
That aye at fall of night our care condoles.
Oh let me, then, his strange love still admire:
   Her face was vail'd, yet to my fancied sight,
I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decrees
Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck.
What ever future sins should me miscall,
Islanded; but no foolish terror thrills
